Text Data File Utility Tool
An open source simple data file processing and manipulation tool aimed at empowerong users to perform most common data processing/manipulation tasks within the tool itself which otherwise require cross domain expertise (like RDBMS, SQL/PLSQL, Statistics, graphics/visualization) and tool-hopping (i.e. excel, JMP, R, Spotfire etc.). The tool combines the power of simple database queries and versatility of excel or Sportfire like features directly into the tool. DFUT's guiding principle and focus is to target most common data processing tasks.
